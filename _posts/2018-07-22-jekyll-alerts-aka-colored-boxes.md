As default markdown does not provide colorful elements for blog posts, one might need some outside help.

Luckily Jekyll offers some options that can be used. These are known as [alerts](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_alerts.html).

## Note
It looks something like
{% include note.html content="Nice blue note" %}
