# Steam required additional 57.51 GB download for a review

If you have used [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), you know that you can download and install games with it. After playing games, you can also write reviews about those games. Unfortunately writing a review might not be that easy with Steam.

## Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition issue

Last month I bought **Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition** from Steam. Today I completed the game, and I wanted to write a review about it. Steam has write a review option, but for this release it doesn't work. It only gives generic _"There was a problem posting your review."_ error when one tries to submit a review for this game.

I am not a first person to notice [this issue](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1449560/discussions/0/3111405265466379444/). The problem seems to be that Steam doesn't have store page for Enhanced Edition, so nobody can post reviews there even when Steam suggests that you should post a review about the game. Naturally one can post a review for **Metro Exodus** since it does have a store page.

I assume this issue also bothers some other relases.

But since both Metro Exodus and Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition are separate items in Steam, I have to download Metro Exodus before I can write a review for it.

## 57.51 GB download

So I started a 57.51 GB download from Steam, so I can just write a review.
