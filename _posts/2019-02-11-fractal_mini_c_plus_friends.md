Sometimes you are seeking some info from internet about what components can be fitted in certain cases. So here is my input:

![Fractal Design Define Mini C and friends]({{ site.url }}/images/fractal_define_mini_c_plus_others.jpg)

* Case is **Fractal Design Define Mini C**
* Motherboard is **MSI MAG Z390M MORTAR**
* CPU cooler is **Be quiet! Dark Rock 4**
* GPU is **GeForce GTX 1070 GAMING X 8G**

Build order:

1. Install CPU to motherboard
2. Install memory to motherboard
3. Attach motherboard to case
4. Install CPU cooler (works with this case since there is installation cutout on the back side of the case)
5. Install power supply to the bottom of the case (in case of modular power supply, connect right cables before inserting the power supply)
5. Connect/route cables (motherboard IO, power cables, fan cables etc.)
6. Install GPU
