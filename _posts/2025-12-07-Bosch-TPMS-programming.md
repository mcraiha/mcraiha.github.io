# Bosch TPMS programming

If you just bought new tires for your car with **Bosch** TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) sensors and you want to program them without **TPA 300** device then there are couple of tools you can use.

## Hamaton H57

The [Hamaton H57](https://www.hamaton-tpms.com/pages/product_details.php?product=HAM-D081) is the one I used. I do not own the device, but local tire shop has the device. It was quite easy to select the right car model from the device. After that you just move the device next to each tire separately, and the programming took like a 5 seconds per tire sensor. 

After the programming was completed, I had to drive for about 30 minutes before that car would correctly detect the new sensors. Unfortunately the car's dashboard doesn't have any progress indicator for the learning process so you just have to drive and hope for the best.

## Other devices

Bosch has [a list](https://www.fcpeuro.com/public/assets/products/692005/large/BOS-QF0471-pdf.jpg?1747145653) of devices that should be compatible, but I have not tested those.
